Project Overview:
This project aims to develop a robust and efficient system for identifying and classifying climbing holds and climbing volumes on indoor climbing walls. 

Data Collection:
To achieve accurate detection and classification, an extensive dataset of climbing wall images is being created. This dataset  include diverse climbing routes with various types of holds and volumes, captured from different angles, lighting conditions, and backgrounds. The images will cover a wide range of climbing holds, such as jugs, crimps, slopers, pockets, and various climbing volumes, including cubes, wedges, and features of different shapes and sizes.

Annotation:
Each image in the dataset has been meticulously annotated with bounding boxes around individual climbing holds and climbing volumes. Annotation has been perform by me. However, to enhance the quality of the dataset, external contributions and collaboration from the climbing community are welcomed.

Open Call for Collaboration:
This project embraces an open and collaborative approach. If you are passionate about climbing and have experience in artificial intellignece and would like to contribute to this project, you are encouraged to participate. By joining the effort, you can help improve the dataset by annotating additional climbing wall images, thereby enhancing the model's performance and overall effectiveness.
